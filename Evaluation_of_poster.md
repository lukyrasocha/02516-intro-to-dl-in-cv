# Laytout to change
- Less and text with smaller textsize
- Change layout so we do not waste that much space
- Make a standard for the axis and text size (Global)
- Make boxes around each section 
- Display images side by side without white space inbetween (the figures with GradCam and SmoothGrad)
- Change latex equation style to match the text
- Remove the gray background

# Things to remember
- Implement tables
- Images of the filters
- Figure out to print
